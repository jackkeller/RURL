## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```
If you'd like to see your build locally make sure you have `serve` installed (globally is best) and drop into the `dist` folder and run `serve -s` and you should be able to see any potential production issues with your dependencies.

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
